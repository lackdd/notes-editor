Certainly! Let's break down the explanation into three parts: what the tool does, its usage with examples, and how the data is stored.

### 1\. What the Tool Does

The tool is a command-line note-taking application designed to manage notes within collections. Here's a summary of its functionality:

*   **Password Protection**: Before accessing the tool, users must enter a password which is hashed using a simple ROT13 cipher for basic security.
    
*   **Note Management**: Once authenticated, users can perform several operations:
    
    *   **Show Notes**: Display all existing notes within a specified collection.
    *   **Add a Note**: Create and append a new note to the collection. Each note includes a timestamp, title, tags, and content. Notes are encrypted using ROT13 before being stored.
    *   **Delete a Note**: Remove a selected note from the collection. Users choose the note by its index number.
*   **User Interface**: The tool provides a text-based interface where users interact by selecting options (show notes, add a note, delete a note, or exit).
    

### 2\. Usage of the Tool

To use the tool, follow these steps:

*   **Command-line Argument**: Execute the tool with a collection name provided as a command-line argument. For example:
    
    ```bash
    ./notestool my_collection
    ```
    
    Replace `my_collection` with your desired collection name.
    
*   **Operations**:
    
    *   **Show Notes**: Enter `1` to view all notes in the collection.
    *   **Add a Note**: Enter `2` to create a new note, providing a title, tags, and content when prompted.
    *   **Delete a Note**: Enter `3` to delete a note, selecting the note by its displayed number.
    *   **Exit**: Enter `4` to quit the application.
*   **Password Management**: Upon first use, set a password. Subsequent logins require entering this password for access.
    

### 3\. Data Storage

*   **File Storage**: Notes are stored in plaintext within a `.txt` file named after the provided collection name (`your_collection_name.txt`).
    
*   **Note Format**: Each note is formatted with metadata including:
    
    *   **Timestamp**: Date of note creation.
    *   **Title**: Brief title describing the note.
    *   **Tags**: Keywords associated with the note, separated by commas.
    *   **Content**: Detailed content of the note.
*   **Encryption**: Notes are encrypted using ROT13 cipher before being stored in the file. This is a basic encryption method that shifts each letter by 13 places in the alphabet, making it reversible.
    

This setup allows users to manage, view, add, and delete notes effectively through a straightforward command-line interface, ensuring basic security and organization of their information.
